### Focus Areas
I chose to prioritize making sure network utilization was as low as possible, caching images and saving the JSON data directly to the disk.

I also chose to prioritize simplicity and minimalism with the design, making a simple list of recipes and allowing the user to open the YouTube link to view how to make the recipe.

Finally, since I am new to unit testing and caching different types of data, focusing on aquiring more skill and knowledge on the topic was a high priority during this project.

### Time Spent
I allocated most of my time implementing efficient network usage and debugging the JSON data. I also decided to split my time for more intensive features, such as using more time for network efficiency and debugging. I also descided to make a simple UI to make the app as light as possible

### Trade-Offs and Decisions
Since I am new to unit testing and caching data, and to meet the deadline, I had to allocate more of my time to debugging and aquiring knowledge on topics I thought were most important. I had a lot of ideas on how I could make the UI more appealing and accessible, such as implementing a search feature for the recipes, making collapsible sections, and implementing Dynamic Type and accessibility labels for VoiceOver features.

### Weakest Part
I believe the weakest part is the UI. As stated in my **trade-offs**, I wanted to implement more features, but because aquiring unit testing and debugging skills were a higher priority, I wasn't able to implement as many of the features I would have liked to.
